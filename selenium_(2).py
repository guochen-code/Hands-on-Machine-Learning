'''
Example 1: <div> is a child of <button>
html
Copy code
<button>
    <div class="small-text">Main 2 Games</div>
</button>
First Snippet: Works fine, because the <div> is a descendant of the <button>.
Second Snippet: Works fine as well, since the <div> is a direct child.
  
Example 2: <div> is a descendant (not a direct child)
html
Copy code
<button>
    <span>
        <div class="small-text">Main 2 Games</div>
    </span>
</button>
First Snippet: Works perfectly, as it looks for any descendant <div> of the <button>.
Second Snippet: Fails, because the <div> is not a direct child of the <button>.

Example 3: <div> is outside the <button>
html
Copy code
<div>
    <button>Click me!</button>
    <div class="small-text">Main 2 Games</div>
</div>
First Snippet: Fails, as the <div> is not a descendant of the <button>.
Second Snippet: Fails as well, since thereâ€™s no <div> within the <button>.

Example 4: Multiple <div> siblings
html
Copy code
<button>
    <div class="small-text">Main 2 Games</div>
    <div>Another Text</div>
</button>
Both Snippets: Both will work, as the <div class="small-text"> is a direct child of the <button>.
Summary:
Use the first snippet (.//div) for scenarios where the <div> might be nested at any level within the <button>.
Use the second snippet (div) when you are sure that the <div> is directly inside the <button>.
