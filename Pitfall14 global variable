In the second code snippet you provided, the reason it works without using the global keyword is 
because you are only reading the value of the count variable inside the function and not modifying it. 
In Python, you can read global variables within a function's scope without declaring them as global.

However, if you try to modify the value of the count variable (as you did in the first code snippet), 
you will need to use the global keyword to indicate that 
you want to modify the global variable rather than create a new local variable with the same name.

So, in the second code snippet, you're just reading the value of the count variable, 
which is allowed without using the global keyword. In the first code snippet, 
you are modifying the value of the count variable, which requires the use of global to indicate that you're modifying the global variable.
