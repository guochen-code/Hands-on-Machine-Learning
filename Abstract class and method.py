abstract class are classes that contain one or more abstract methods.
an abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation.
abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and require subclasses to probide implementation for the abstract methods.
subclasses of an abstract class in python are not required to implement abstract methods of the parent class.
