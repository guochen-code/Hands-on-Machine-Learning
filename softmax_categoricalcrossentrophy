softmax:
3 classes - 3 nodes - 3 values
3 values - 3 probabilities with summation = 1
p1 = exp(v1)/(exp(v1)+exp(v2)+exp(v3))
p1+p2+p3=1


what get into CategoricalCrossentropy must be logits tensor, if it is not, which means, they are not probabilities with summation =1, then set from_logits=True
from_logits = False by default, it assumes values to loss function is after softmax
otherwise, set from_logits=True

from_logits: whether y_pred is expected to be a logits tensor. by default, we assume that y_pred encodes a probability distribution.
