(1) speaker mixed up
linux: auido input and output are async, causing multiple wake ups
solution: enforce audio stream closed before entering into conversation flow

(2) multithreading
linux: np.dot(), locked the entire app, indefinite hanging
solution: replace np.dot() 
check:
https://superfastpython.com/multithreaded-numpy-functions/
feat = np.dot(pspec,fb.T)
feat = np.sum(pspec[:,np.newaxis,:] * fb[np.newaxis,:,:], axis=2)

(3) memory leak
open recorder but not stop because of exception
threading.py memory building up.... one of the thread is not closed.....if the total number of threads stays stable somehow.......
