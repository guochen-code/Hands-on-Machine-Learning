(1) missing values can be hidden from us and replaced by other value such as -1 / plot histogram to identify any unusal peaks.
(2) fillna approaches:
  2.1 -999,-1 etc:
  2.2 mean, median:
  2.3 reconstruct value: 
(3) create isnull feature.
(4) be very careful when generating new feature using columns with missing values. for example, ignore missing values when calculate means for each category.
(5) sometimes we can treat outliers as missing values.
