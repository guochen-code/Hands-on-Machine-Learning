'''
Example 1: <div> is a child of <button>
html
Copy code
<button>
    <div class="small-text">Main 2 Games</div>
</button>
First Snippet: Works fine, because the <div> is a descendant of the <button>.
Second Snippet: Works fine as well, since the <div> is a direct child.
  
Example 2: <div> is a descendant (not a direct child)
html
Copy code
<button>
    <span>
        <div class="small-text">Main 2 Games</div>
    </span>
</button>
First Snippet: Works perfectly, as it looks for any descendant <div> of the <button>.
Second Snippet: Fails, because the <div> is not a direct child of the <button>.

Example 3: <div> is outside the <button>
html
Copy code
<div>
    <button>Click me!</button>
    <div class="small-text">Main 2 Games</div>
</div>
First Snippet: Fails, as the <div> is not a descendant of the <button>.
Second Snippet: Fails as well, since thereâ€™s no <div> within the <button>.

Example 4: Multiple <div> siblings
html
Copy code
<button>
    <div class="small-text">Main 2 Games</div>
    <div>Another Text</div>
</button>
Both Snippets: Both will work, as the <div class="small-text"> is a direct child of the <button>.
Summary:
Use the first snippet (.//div) for scenarios where the <div> might be nested at any level within the <button>.
Use the second snippet (div) when you are sure that the <div> is directly inside the <button>.

Snippet 1
python
Copy code
main_2_games_button = wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable(
    (By.XPATH, "//button[div[contains(@class, 'small-text') and contains(text(), 'Main 2 Games')]]")
))
Functionality: This snippet looks for a <button> that contains a <div> with the class small-text and that includes the text "Main 2 Games" anywhere in the text.
Pros: Using contains(text(), 'Main 2 Games') allows for partial matches. If there are other words or text in the <div>, it will still match as long as "Main 2 Games" is part of the text.
Cons: It might match more than you intend if there are multiple elements containing that phrase.
Snippet 2
python
Copy code
main_2_games_button = wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable(
    (By.XPATH, "//button[div[contains(@class, 'small-text') and text()='Main 2 Games']]")
))
main_2_games_button.click()
Functionality: This snippet also looks for a <button> containing a <div> with the class small-text, but it requires an exact match for the text "Main 2 Games."
Pros: This is more specific and will only match if the <div> has exactly "Main 2 Games" as its text, with no additional text.
Cons: If there is any extra whitespace or additional text, it will not match.
Summary
Use Snippet 1 when you want to allow for partial matches or when the text might include additional content. It's more flexible but can lead to unintended matches.
Use Snippet 2 when you want to ensure an exact match for the text. This is safer if you're sure the text will always be exactly as specified.
